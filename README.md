# Predicting-Ocular-Survival-and-Success-of-Treatmeant-of-Retinoblastoma-Patients
Academic project:

Using both supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, this project aims to answer three questions based on a clinical dataset with sample size of 87 eyes of retinoblastoma patients. 
The goal is to unveil interesting behaviours or dependencies that could be potentially be used in a healthcare setting. 

Machine learning algorithms including:
  - K-means clustering 
  - Hierachical clustering
  - Logistic regression
  - Gradient boosting
  - Simple linear regression
